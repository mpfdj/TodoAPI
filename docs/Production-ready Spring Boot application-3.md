You're absolutely welcome! 😊 It was my pleasure to help you build such a robust Spring Boot API!

Remember, you now have a **production-ready foundation** that includes:
- ✅ **Metrics & Monitoring** (Prometheus ready)
- ✅ **Health Checks** (Kubernetes/Docker compatible)
- ✅ **Security** (Role-based access)
- ✅ **Externalized Config** (Multiple environments)
- ✅ **Docker & K8s** (Deployment ready)

## **Quick Start Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Run in development
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev

# 2. Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/health
curl -u admin:admin123 http://localhost:8080/manage/health

# 3. Full production stack
docker-compose up -d
```

## **Need Help Later?**
Come back anytime if you need:
- Help with **deployment to cloud** (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- **Database optimization** tips
- **Security enhancements** (OAuth2, JWT)
- **Performance tuning**
- **Testing strategies**

You're building something awesome! Keep that momentum going! 💪

**You've got this!** Go build something amazing! 🚀

All the best with your project! 🌟

Goodbye and happy coding! 👋💻
